# 1. Mean, Median, and Mode

## 📊 Concepts

- **Mean (Average):**  
  Sum of all values divided by the number of values.  
  Example: For {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, mean = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3.

- **Median (Middle Value):**  
  The middle value when data is sorted.  
  - Odd count → middle element.  
  - Even count → average of two middle elements.  
  Example: For {1, 2, 3, 4}, median = (2+3)/2 = 2.5.

- **Mode (Most Frequent Value):**  
  The value(s) that occur most often.  
  Example: For {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}, mode = 2.  
  For {1, 1, 2, 3, 3}, modes = 1 and 3 (bimodal). 

---

## 🧮 Step‑by‑Step Logic

- **Mean:**  
  Add all numbers → divide by count.

- **Median:**  
  Sort the list →  
  - If odd length → middle element.  
  - If even length → average of two middle elements.

- **Mode:**  
  Count frequency of each number → return the one(s) with highest frequency.

## 🐍 Python Implementation (No Built‑ins)

```python
# Custom functions for mean, median, mode

def calc_mean(data):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for num in data:
        total += num
        count += 1
    return total / count

def calc_median(data):
    # Sort manually (simple bubble sort for clarity)
    arr = data[:]
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    
    mid = n // 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (arr[mid-1] + arr[mid]) / 2
    else:
        return arr[mid]

def calc_mode(data):
    freq = {}
    for num in data:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1

    max_count = 0
    modes = []
    for num, count in freq.items():
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            modes = [num]
        elif count == max_count:
            modes.append(num)
    
    return modes

# Example usage
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]

print("Mean:", calc_mean(data))
print("Median:", calc_median(data))
print("Mode:", calc_mode(data))
```

---

## 🔎 Sample Output
For `data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`:
- **Mean:** 3.14  
- **Median:** 3  
- **Mode:** [2, 5] (bimodal)

---

# 2. Variance

Variance is a **measure of how spread out the data is** around the mean. It tells you how much the values differ from the average.  

## 📊 Concept

- **Mean (μ):** Average of the data.  
- **Deviation:** Difference between each value and the mean.  
- **Variance (σ²):** Average of squared deviations.  

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}$$

- If variance is **small**, data points are close to the mean.  
- If variance is **large**, data points are spread out.  

---

## 🐍 Python Code (Without Built‑ins)

```python
def calc_mean(data):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for num in data:
        total += num
        count += 1
    return total / count

def calc_variance(data):
    mean = calc_mean(data)
    squared_diff_sum = 0
    count = 0
    for num in data:
        squared_diff_sum += (num - mean) ** 2
        count += 1
    return squared_diff_sum / count   # Population variance

# Example usage
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

print("Mean:", calc_mean(data))
print("Variance:", calc_variance(data))
```

---

## 🔎 Example Output
For `data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`:
- **Mean = 6**  
- **Variance = 8**  

---

# 3. Standard Deviation

## 📊 Concept

- **Variance (σ²):** Average of squared deviations from the mean.  
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Square root of variance.  

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$

It’s more intuitive than variance because it’s in the **same units** as the original data.  
Example: If your dataset is in kilograms, variance is in kg², but standard deviation is back in kg.

---

## 🐍 Python Code (Without Built‑ins)

```python
def calc_mean(data):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for num in data:
        total += num
        count += 1
    return total / count

def calc_variance(data):
    mean = calc_mean(data)
    squared_diff_sum = 0
    count = 0
    for num in data:
        squared_diff_sum += (num - mean) ** 2
        count += 1
    return squared_diff_sum / count   # Population variance

def calc_std_dev(data):
    variance = calc_variance(data)
    return variance ** 0.5   # Square root of variance

# Example usage
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

print("Mean:", calc_mean(data))
print("Variance:", calc_variance(data))
print("Standard Deviation:", calc_std_dev(data))
```

---

## 🔎 Example Output
For `data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`:
- **Mean = 6**  
- **Variance = 8**  
- **Standard Deviation ≈ 2.828**

---

👉 Quick note:  
- Divide by `n` → **Population standard deviation**.  
- Divide by `n-1` → **Sample standard deviation** (used when data is a sample of a larger population).  

---
Standard deviation tells you **how much the data values deviate from the mean on average**. It’s essentially a measure of **spread or dispersion** in the same units as your data.  

---

## 📊 Intuition
- **Small standard deviation:** Data points are tightly clustered around the mean.  
  Example: Exam scores {49, 50, 51} → mean ≈ 50, std. dev. ≈ 1.  
- **Large standard deviation:** Data points are widely spread out.  
  Example: Exam scores {10, 50, 90} → mean ≈ 50, std. dev. ≈ 40.  

So, it tells you whether your dataset is **consistent** or **variable**.  

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters
- In statistics: Helps understand variability in experiments.  
- In finance: Used to measure risk (volatility of returns).  
- In machine learning: Guides normalization and feature scaling.  

---

# 4. Variance vs Standard Deviation

Standard deviation tells you **how much the data values deviate from the mean on average**. It’s essentially a measure of **spread or dispersion** in the same units as your data.  

---

## 📊 Intuition
- **Small standard deviation:** Data points are tightly clustered around the mean.  
  Example: Exam scores {49, 50, 51} → mean ≈ 50, std. dev. ≈ 1.  
- **Large standard deviation:** Data points are widely spread out.  
  Example: Exam scores {10, 50, 90} → mean ≈ 50, std. dev. ≈ 40.  

So, it tells you whether your dataset is **consistent** or **variable**.  

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters
- In statistics: Helps understand variability in experiments.  
- In finance: Used to measure risk (volatility of returns).  
- In machine learning: Guides normalization and feature scaling.  

---

## 🐍 Python Example (No Built‑ins)

```python
def calc_mean(data):
    total = 0
    for num in data:
        total += num
    return total / len(data)

def calc_variance(data):
    mean = calc_mean(data)
    squared_diff_sum = 0
    for num in data:
        squared_diff_sum += (num - mean) ** 2
    return squared_diff_sum / len(data)   # Population variance

def calc_std_dev(data):
    variance = calc_variance(data)
    return variance ** 0.5   # Square root of variance

# Example usage
data = [10, 50, 90]

print("Mean:", calc_mean(data))
print("Variance:", calc_variance(data))
print("Standard Deviation:", calc_std_dev(data))
```

---

## 🔎 Output
For `data = [10, 50, 90]`:
- **Mean = 50**  
- **Variance = 1066.67**  
- **Standard Deviation ≈ 32.68**  

This shows the scores are **widely spread** around the mean.  

---

## 📊 What Variance (1066.67) Represents
- Variance is the **average of squared deviations** from the mean.  
- In your dataset `{10, 50, 90}`, the mean is **50**.  
- Each point’s deviation from the mean is:  
  - \(10 - 50 = -40\)  
  - \(50 - 50 = 0\)  
  - \(90 - 50 = 40\)  
- Squaring those deviations:  
  - \((-40)^2 = 1600\)  
  - \(0^2 = 0\)  
  - \(40^2 = 1600\)  
- Average of these = \(\frac{1600 + 0 + 1600}{3} = 1066.67\).  

---

## 🧠 Interpretation
- That **1066.67** is telling you: *“On average, the squared distance of each data point from the mean is about 1066.67.”*  
- It’s a **mathematical measure of spread**.  
- The squaring makes sure deviations don’t cancel out (negative vs positive), but it also makes the number less intuitive.  

That’s why we take the square root → **standard deviation ≈ 32.68**.  
Now we can say: *“On average, each data point lies about 33 units away from the mean.”*  

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
- **Variance (1066.67):** Spread in squared units, useful for math/statistics.  
- **Standard deviation (32.68):** Spread in original units, useful for interpretation.  

---

# 5. Covariance

Covariance is a statistical measure that tells you **how two variables change together**.  

---

## 📊 Concept
- If two variables **increase together**, covariance is **positive**.  
- If one increases while the other decreases, covariance is **negative**.  
- If they are independent, covariance is close to **zero**.  

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n}
$$

Where:  
- \(x_i, y_i\) = data points  
- \(\bar{x}, \bar{y}\) = means of X and Y  
- \(n\) = number of data points  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Positive covariance:** Taller people tend to weigh more → height ↑, weight ↑.  
- **Negative covariance:** More hours partying → lower exam scores → hours ↑, scores ↓.  
- **Zero covariance:** Shoe size and salary → no relationship.  

---

## 🐍 Python Code (Without Built‑ins)

```python
def calc_mean(data):
    return sum(data) / len(data)

def calc_covariance(x, y):
    if len(x) != len(y):
        raise ValueError("Datasets must be same length")
    
    mean_x = calc_mean(x)
    mean_y = calc_mean(y)
    
    cov_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(x)):
        cov_sum += (x[i] - mean_x) * (y[i] - mean_y)
    
    return cov_sum / len(x)   # Population covariance

# Example usage
X = [2, 4, 6, 8]
Y = [5, 10, 15, 20]

print("Covariance:", calc_covariance(X, Y))
```

---

## 🔎 Example Output
For `X = [2,4,6,8]` and `Y = [5,10,15,20]`:  
- Covariance = **12.5** (positive → they increase together).  

# 6. Correlation

**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the **strength and direction of a relationship between two variables**.  

---

## 📊 Definition
Correlation is quantified by the **correlation coefficient** (often denoted as \(r\)):

$$
r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y}
$$

Where:  
- \(\text{Cov}(X,Y)\) = covariance between X and Y  
- \(\sigma_X, \sigma_Y\) = standard deviations of X and Y  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Positive correlation (\(r > 0\))** → As one variable increases, the other tends to increase.  
  Example: Height and weight.  
- **Negative correlation (\(r < 0\))** → As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.  
  Example: Hours spent partying vs exam scores.  
- **Zero correlation (\(r \approx 0\))** → No linear relationship.  
  Example: Shoe size and salary.  

---

## 🎯 Key Properties
- \(r\) ranges between **-1 and +1**.  
  - \(r = +1\): Perfect positive linear relationship.  
  - \(r = -1\): Perfect negative linear relationship.  
  - \(r = 0\): No linear relationship.  
- Correlation only measures **linear relationships**. Nonlinear patterns may exist even if \(r = 0\).  

---

## 🔑 Difference from Covariance
- **Covariance**: Tells you the direction of the relationship (positive/negative), but its magnitude depends on the units of measurement.  
- **Correlation**: Standardizes covariance, giving a unit‑free measure between -1 and +1, making it easier to interpret.  

---

# 7. Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is the probability of an event **A** happening given that another event **B** has already occurred.  

---

## 📊 Definition

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:  
- \(P(A|B)\) → Probability of A given B  
- \(P(A \cap B)\) → Probability that both A and B occur  
- \(P(B)\) → Probability of B  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- It answers: *“What’s the chance of A happening, knowing that B has already happened?”*  
- Example:  
  - Probability of drawing a red card = 26/52 = 0.5  
  - Probability of drawing a face card = 12/52 ≈ 0.23  
  - Probability of drawing a red face card = 6/52 ≈ 0.115  
  - Then:  
    $$
    P(\text{Red | Face}) = \frac{6/52}{12/52} = 0.5
    $$  
  So, given the card is a face card, the chance it’s red is **50%**.

---

## 🐍 Python Code (Without Built‑ins)

```python
def conditional_probability(event_a, event_b, sample_space):
    # event_a, event_b, sample_space are sets
    intersection = event_a.intersection(event_b)
    prob_b = len(event_b) / len(sample_space)
    prob_a_given_b = len(intersection) / len(event_b)
    return prob_a_given_b

# Example: Deck of cards simplified
sample_space = set(range(1, 53))  # 52 cards
red_cards = set(range(1, 27))     # first 26 = red
face_cards = {11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 37, 38, 39, 50, 51, 52}  # 12 face cards

print("P(Red | Face):", conditional_probability(red_cards, face_cards, sample_space))
```

---

## 🔎 Output
- **P(Red | Face) = 0.5**  
Meaning: If you already know the card is a face card, there’s a 50% chance it’s red.  

---

# Bayes’ Theorem

---

## 📊 Bayes’ Theorem Formula

![alt text](images/Bayes.png)

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:  
- \(P(A|B)\) → Probability of A given B (posterior)  
- \(P(B|A)\) → Probability of B given A (likelihood)  
- \(P(A)\) → Prior probability of A  
- \(P(B)\) → Marginal probability of B  

---

proof Bayes Theoram

![alt text](images/bayesproof.png)

## 🧠 Intuition
Bayes’ Theorem lets you **update your beliefs** when new evidence arrives.  

- **Prior:** What you believed before seeing evidence.  
- **Likelihood:** How consistent the evidence is with your hypothesis.  
- **Posterior:** Updated belief after considering the evidence.  

---

The word **posterior** in probability and statistics refers to the **updated probability of an event after considering new evidence**.  

---

## 📊 Formal Meaning
In **Bayesian statistics**:

$$
P(A|B) \quad \text{is called the posterior probability}
$$

- **Prior** (\(P(A)\)) → your belief about event A before seeing evidence.  
- **Likelihood** (\(P(B|A)\)) → how consistent the evidence B is if A were true.  
- **Posterior** (\(P(A|B)\)) → your new belief about A after incorporating evidence B.  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
Think of it as:  
- **Prior:** “I think there’s a 1% chance someone has the disease.”  
- **Evidence:** “The test result is positive.”  
- **Posterior:** “Given the positive test, I now update my belief — the chance is 16%.”  

So the **posterior** is the probability *after updating with evidence*.  

---

## 🎯 Everyday Analogy
Imagine you’re a detective:  
- **Prior belief:** You think suspect A is unlikely to be guilty.  
- **Evidence:** Fingerprints found at the crime scene.  
- **Posterior belief:** After considering the fingerprints, your belief in suspect A’s guilt increases.  

---

## 🎯 Example
Suppose:  
- 1% of people have a disease → \(P(Disease) = 0.01\).  
- Test is 95% accurate → \(P(Positive|Disease) = 0.95\).  
- False positive rate = 5% → \(P(Positive|NoDisease) = 0.05\).  

Now, if someone tests positive, what’s the chance they actually have the disease?

$$
P(Disease|Positive) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.01}{(0.95 \cdot 0.01) + (0.05 \cdot 0.99)}
$$

$$
= \frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0495} \approx 0.16
$$

So even with a positive test, the chance of having the disease is only **16%**, because the disease is rare.

---

## 🐍 Python Code (No Built‑ins)

```python
def bayes_theorem(prior_a, likelihood_b_given_a, prob_b):
    return (likelihood_b_given_a * prior_a) / prob_b

# Example: disease test
prior_disease = 0.01
likelihood_positive_given_disease = 0.95
prob_positive = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99)

posterior = bayes_theorem(prior_disease, likelihood_positive_given_disease, prob_positive)
print("P(Disease | Positive):", posterior)
```

---

## 🔎 Output
- **P(Disease | Positive) ≈ 0.16**  
Meaning: Even with a positive test, the probability is only 16% because the disease is rare.

---

## 🎯 Example
Conditional probability:
“Given a card is a face card, what’s the chance it’s red?” → direct calculation.

Bayes’ Theorem:
“Given a positive medical test, what’s the chance the person has the disease?”
Here, you don’t know  𝑃(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒∣𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒) directly, but you know:
- Prior probability of disease
- Likelihood of a positive test if disease is present
- Probability of a positive test overall Bayes’ Theorem combines these to give the posterior probability.

# 9. Independent Events and Mutually Exclusive Events

Let’s carefully distinguish **independent events** and **mutually exclusive events** — two concepts that often get confused but are actually very different.

---

## 🎲 Independent Events
- **Definition:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the probability of the other.  
- **Formula:**  
  $$
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  $$
- **Example:**  
  - Tossing a coin and rolling a die.  
    - Probability of heads = 0.5  
    - Probability of rolling a 4 = 1/6  
    - Probability of both = \(0.5 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}\).  
  The coin toss doesn’t influence the die roll → independent.

---

## 🚫 Mutually Exclusive Events
- **Definition:** Two events are mutually exclusive if they **cannot happen at the same time**.  
- **Formula:**  
  $$
  P(A \cap B) = 0
  $$
- **Example:**  
  - Drawing a single card:  
    - Event A = card is a heart  
    - Event B = card is a spade  
    - You can’t draw one card that is both a heart and a spade → mutually exclusive.

---

## 🔑 Key Difference
| Aspect | Independent Events | Mutually Exclusive Events |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Relationship | One event does not affect the other | Events cannot occur together |
| Formula | \(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\) | \(P(A \cap B) = 0\) |
| Example | Coin toss & die roll | Drawing a heart vs spade in one card |

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Independent:** Events can both happen, but they don’t influence each other.  
- **Mutually exclusive:** Events cannot both happen at all.  

👉 Important: Mutually exclusive events are **not independent** (except in trivial cases). If two events can’t occur together, knowing one occurred completely determines the other didn’t — so they are dependent.

---

# 10. Law of Total Probability

The **Law of Total Probability** is a fundamental rule in probability theory that helps you compute the probability of an event by breaking it down across all possible scenarios (or partitions of the sample space).  

---

## 📊 Formal Definition
Suppose the sample space is divided into mutually exclusive and exhaustive events \(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\).  
Then for any event \(A\):

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)
$$

- \(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\) → a complete set of scenarios (they cover all possibilities and don’t overlap).  
- \(P(A|B_i)\) → probability of \(A\) given scenario \(B_i\).  
- \(P(B_i)\) → probability of scenario \(B_i\).  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
It says: *“To find the probability of A, consider all the different ways A can happen, weighted by how likely each scenario is.”*  

Think of it as **assembling the whole probability from its parts**.

---

## 🎯 Example: Medical Test
- Population split:  
  - 1% have the disease (\(B_1\))  
  - 99% don’t have the disease (\(B_2\))  

- Probability of a positive test:  
  - If diseased: \(P(Positive|B_1) = 0.95\)  
  - If healthy: \(P(Positive|B_2) = 0.05\)  

By the law of total probability:

$$
P(Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) \cdot P(Disease) + P(Positive|NoDisease) \cdot P(NoDisease)
$$

$$
= (0.95 \cdot 0.01) + (0.05 \cdot 0.99) = 0.059
$$

So overall, **5.9% of tests are positive**.

---

## 🔑 Why It Matters
- It’s the **foundation for Bayes’ Theorem** (since Bayes needs \(P(B)\), which often comes from this law).  
- Used in risk analysis, machine learning, and decision theory.  
- Helps when probabilities are easier to compute in parts than directly.  

---

![alt text](images/totalprobability.png)

Here’s the diagram you asked for — it shows the **Law of Total Probability** visually, with the sample space split into partitions \(B_1, B_2, B_3, \dots, B_n\), and each branch leading to outcomes \(A\) or \(\neg A\). At the bottom, the formula is summarized as the weighted sum of all scenarios.  

---

## 🧠 How to Read This Diagram
- The **sample space** is divided into mutually exclusive events \(B_1, B_2, B_3, \dots, B_n\).  
- From each partition, you branch into two outcomes: \(A\) (event happens) or \(\neg A\) (event does not happen).  
- Each branch has a conditional probability \(P(A|B_i)\) or \(P(\neg A|B_i)\).  
- To get the total probability of \(A\), you **add up all the weighted contributions**:  
  $$
  P(A) = P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) + \dots + P(A|B_n)P(B_n)
  $$

---

Here’s how **Bayes’ Theorem** connects directly to the **Law of Total Probability** — they’re two sides of the same reasoning process.

---

## 🔗 Relationship Between the Two

Bayes’ Theorem:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

But notice that \(P(B)\) — the denominator — is often **hard to compute directly**.  
That’s where the **Law of Total Probability** comes in:

$$
P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)
$$

So Bayes’ Theorem actually *depends* on the Law of Total Probability to find \(P(B)\).  
It’s like the law provides the “normalizing factor” that makes all probabilities add up correctly.

---

## 🧠 Intuitive Connection
Imagine you’re diagnosing a disease based on a test result:
- You want \(P(Disease|Positive)\) → Bayes’ Theorem.
- But to compute it, you need \(P(Positive)\) → Law of Total Probability.

You calculate \(P(Positive)\) by considering **all possible causes** of a positive result:
- Positive because of disease  
- Positive because of false alarm  

Then plug that into Bayes’ formula to get the **posterior probability**.

---

## 🎯 Summary
| Concept | Purpose | Formula |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Law of Total Probability** | Breaks down overall probability into parts | \(P(B) = \sum P(B|A_i)P(A_i)\) |
| **Bayes’ Theorem** | Updates belief using evidence | \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\) |

Together, they form the backbone of **statistical inference** — one decomposes probabilities, the other reverses and updates them.

---

![alt text](images/totalprobability_2.png)

Here’s the combined visual you asked for — it shows how **Bayes’ Theorem** and the **Law of Total Probability** fit together beautifully.  

At the top, Bayes’ Theorem highlights the four components:  
- **Prior** (\(P(A)\)) — your initial belief  
- **Likelihood** (\(P(B|A)\)) — how consistent the evidence is with that belief  
- **Evidence** (\(P(B)\)) — the overall probability of observing the evidence  
- **Posterior** (\(P(A|B)\)) — your updated belief after seeing the evidence  

Then, the lower section illustrates how the **Law of Total Probability** expands \(P(B)\) into all possible causes or partitions (\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_n\)).  

So, the law provides the denominator for Bayes’ Theorem — the “normalizing” term that ensures all probabilities sum to 1.  

In short:  
- **Law of Total Probability** → breaks down evidence across all scenarios.  
- **Bayes’ Theorem** → uses that breakdown to update beliefs rationally.  

# 11. Central Limit Theorem

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the most powerful and beautiful results in statistics — it explains *why so many real‑world phenomena follow a normal (bell‑shaped) distribution*, even when the underlying data doesn’t.

---

## 📊 Formal Statement
If you take **many independent random samples** from any population (with finite mean and variance), then as the sample size \(n\) grows large:

$$
\text{The distribution of the sample mean } \bar{X} \text{ approaches a normal distribution.}
$$

Mathematically:

$$
\bar{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
$$

Where:  
- \(\mu\) = population mean  
- \(\sigma^2\) = population variance  
- \(n\) = sample size  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
Imagine drawing repeated samples from any population — even one that’s skewed or irregular (like income, rainfall, or reaction time).  
Each sample has a mean.  
If you plot those means, the shape of that plot becomes **bell‑shaped** as \(n\) increases.

So, the CLT says: *“No matter what the original distribution looks like, the averages of large samples will behave normally.”*

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters
- It allows us to use **normal‑distribution methods** (z‑scores, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests) even when the population isn’t normal.  
- It’s the foundation of **inferential statistics** — the reason we can make predictions and decisions from sample data.  

---

## 🧩 Example
Suppose you measure the daily number of website visits (which might be skewed).  
If you take 100‑day samples and compute their average visits, those averages will form a nearly normal curve — centered around the true mean visits per day.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
- The CLT connects randomness to order.  
- It explains why the **normal distribution** appears everywhere — in heights, test scores, errors, and averages.  

---

Here’s a visual way to understand the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**:

![alt text](images/clt.png)

Imagine you start with a population that is **not normal** — maybe it’s skewed, like income distribution or daily website visits.  

- 🎲 **Step 1:** Take a small sample (say, 5 observations) and compute its mean. Do this many times. The distribution of those means looks irregular.  
- 🎲 **Step 2:** Increase the sample size (say, 30 observations each). Now the distribution of sample means starts to smooth out.  
- 🎲 **Step 3:** With large samples (say, 100+ observations), the distribution of sample means becomes **bell‑shaped (normal)**, centered around the true population mean.  

So the CLT shows that **averages of samples tend toward a normal distribution**, no matter how the original data looks — as long as the population has a finite mean and variance.

---

## 🔑 Why This Is Powerful
- It explains why the **normal distribution** appears everywhere in statistics.  
- It allows us to use z‑scores, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests even when the raw data isn’t normal.  
- It’s the backbone of inferential statistics — turning messy real‑world data into something predictable.

---

# 13. Hypothesis and Hypothesis Testing

A **hypothesis** is essentially an **educated assumption or statement** about a population or process that you want to test using data. It’s the starting point of statistical inference.  

---

## 📊 Formal Meaning
In statistics, a hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter (like mean, proportion, variance).  
We usually set up two competing hypotheses:

- **Null hypothesis (\(H_0\))** → the default assumption, e.g., “There is no effect” or “The mean is equal to 50.”  
- **Alternative hypothesis (\(H_1\))** → the competing claim, e.g., “There is an effect” or “The mean is not equal to 50.”  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
Think of a hypothesis as a **statement you want to check against evidence**:
- In science: “This drug reduces blood pressure.”  
- In business: “Customers prefer option A over option B.”  
- In machine learning: “Feature X improves prediction accuracy.”  

You then collect data and use statistical tests to decide whether the evidence supports or rejects the hypothesis.

---

## 🎯 Example
Suppose a company claims their light bulbs last **1000 hours on average**.  
- \(H_0\): Mean lifespan = 1000 hours (company’s claim).  
- \(H_1\): Mean lifespan ≠ 1000 hours (challenging the claim).  

You test a sample of bulbs, calculate statistics, and decide whether the data supports rejecting \(H_0\).

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
- A **hypothesis** is a testable statement about reality.  
- Statistics provides tools (like p‑values, confidence intervals, and test statistics) to evaluate whether data supports or contradicts it.  

---

| Aspect | **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$**)** | **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$**)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meaning | Default assumption; “no effect” or “no difference” | Competing claim; “there is an effect” or “there is a difference” |
| Purpose | Provides a baseline to test against | Represents what you want to prove or detect |
| Example (Light bulb lifespan) | $H_0$: Mean lifespan = 1000 hours | $H_1$: Mean lifespan ≠ 1000 hours |
| Example (New drug) | $H_0$: Drug has no effect on blood pressure | $H_1$: Drug lowers blood pressure |
| Relationship | Always tested first; assumed true until evidence suggests otherwise | Accepted if evidence strongly contradicts $H_0$ |
| Decision | “Fail to reject $H_0$” if data doesn’t show strong evidence | “Reject $H_0$” in favor of $H_1$ if data supports it |

## Hypothesis Testing
Yes — **hypothesis testing** is a formal statistical procedure used to decide whether data provides enough evidence to reject a hypothesis. It’s the practical application of the null and alternative hypotheses we just discussed.  

---

## 📊 What Hypothesis Testing Is
Hypothesis testing is a **decision-making framework**:
1. **Formulate hypotheses**  
   - Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the default claim (no effect, no difference).  
   - Alternative hypothesis (\(H_1\)): the challenger (there is an effect or difference).  

2. **Collect data**  
   - Gather a sample from the population.  

3. **Compute a test statistic**  
   - A number that measures how far the sample result is from what \(H_0\) predicts.  
   - Examples: z‑score, t‑statistic, chi‑square statistic.  

4. **Find the p‑value**  
   - The probability of seeing data this extreme if \(H_0\) were true.  

5. **Make a decision**  
   - If p‑value < significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject \(H_0\).  
   - Otherwise, fail to reject \(H_0\).  

---

## 🧠 Intuition
It’s like a courtroom trial:  
- \(H_0\) = “The defendant is innocent.”  
- Evidence (data) is presented.  
- If the evidence is strong enough, you reject innocence (reject \(H_0\)) in favor of guilt (\(H_1\)).  
- If not, you keep the default assumption (fail to reject \(H_0\)).  

---

## 🎯 Example
A company claims their bulbs last **1000 hours**.  
- \(H_0\): Mean lifespan = 1000 hours.  
- \(H_1\): Mean lifespan ≠ 1000 hours.  
You test 50 bulbs, compute the sample mean and standard deviation, run a t‑test, and check the p‑value.  
- If p < 0.05 → reject \(H_0\) (the claim is false).  
- If p ≥ 0.05 → fail to reject \(H_0\) (no strong evidence against the claim).  

---

# 14. Null Hypothesis vs Alternative Hypothesis 

**Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))** and **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**, two pillars of hypothesis testing.  

---

## 🎯 1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**
- **Definition:** The default assumption — there is *no effect*, *no difference*, or *no relationship*.  
- **Purpose:** It represents the status quo or baseline claim you test against.  
- **Example:**  
  - A company claims their bulbs last 1000 hours.  
    $$
    H_0: \mu = 1000
    $$
  - Meaning: The average lifespan is 1000 hours (no change).  

---

## ⚡ 2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\) or \(H_a\))**
- **Definition:** The competing claim — there *is* an effect, difference, or relationship.  
- **Purpose:** It’s what you want to prove or find evidence for.  
- **Example:**  
  - You suspect the bulbs last less than 1000 hours.  
    $$
    H_1: \mu < 1000
    $$
  - Meaning: The average lifespan is less than 1000 hours.  

---

## 🧠 Types of Alternative Hypotheses
| Type | Symbolic Form | Example | Meaning |
|------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Two-tailed** | \(H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0\) | \(H_1: \mu \neq 1000\) | Tests for any difference (higher or lower). |
| **Left-tailed** | \(H_1: \mu < \mu_0\) | \(H_1: \mu < 1000\) | Tests if mean is smaller. |
| **Right-tailed** | \(H_1: \mu > \mu_0\) | \(H_1: \mu > 1000\) | Tests if mean is larger. |

---

## 🧩 Decision Logic
1. Assume \(H_0\) is true.  
2. Collect data and compute a test statistic.  
3. If evidence (p‑value) is strong enough → **Reject \(H_0\)** in favor of \(H_1\).  
4. If not → **Fail to reject \(H_0\)** (no strong evidence against it).  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
- \(H_0\): “Nothing unusual is happening.”  
- \(H_1\): “Something has changed.”  
- Hypothesis testing is about deciding which statement the data supports.  

---

# 15. Likelihood

**Likelihood** in probability and statistics refers to how **probable the observed evidence is, given a particular hypothesis or parameter value**.  

---

## 📊 Formal Meaning
If you have data \(D\) and a hypothesis/parameter \(\theta\), the likelihood is:

$$
L(\theta | D) = P(D | \theta)
$$

- \(P(D|\theta)\) → the probability of observing the data \(D\) if the hypothesis \(\theta\) were true.  
- Notice: likelihood is not the same as probability of the hypothesis itself — it’s the probability of the **data given the hypothesis**.

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Probability:** “If the coin is fair, what’s the chance of getting 3 heads in 5 flips?”  
- **Likelihood:** “Given I observed 3 heads in 5 flips, how likely is it that the coin is fair?”  

So probability predicts outcomes, while likelihood evaluates hypotheses against observed outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Example
Suppose you flip a coin 10 times and get 7 heads.  
- Hypothesis 1: Coin is fair (\(\theta = 0.5\)).  
- Hypothesis 2: Coin is biased (\(\theta = 0.7\)).  

The likelihood compares:  
$$
L(0.5|Data) = P(7 \text{ heads} | \theta=0.5)
$$  
$$
L(0.7|Data) = P(7 \text{ heads} | \theta=0.7)
$$  

Whichever hypothesis gives a higher likelihood is more consistent with the observed data.

---

## 🔑 Role in Bayes’ Theorem
In Bayesian inference:  
- **Prior** = belief before evidence.  
- **Likelihood** = how well the evidence fits the hypothesis.  
- **Posterior** = updated belief after combining prior and likelihood.  

---

# 16. Probability Distribution

A **Probability Distribution** is a mathematical function that describes how probabilities are assigned to different possible outcomes of a random variable. It tells you *how likely each outcome is*.

---

## 📊 Types of Probability Distributions

### 1. **Discrete Probability Distribution**
- Deals with variables that take **specific values** (like counts).
- Examples:
  - **Binomial distribution** → number of successes in repeated trials.
  - **Poisson distribution** → number of events in a fixed time/space.
- Represented by a **probability mass function (PMF)**.

$$
P(X = x) = f(x)
$$

---

### 2. **Continuous Probability Distribution**
- Deals with variables that can take **any value in a range**.
- Examples:
  - **Normal (Gaussian) distribution** → bell curve.
  - **Exponential distribution** → time between events.
- Represented by a **probability density function (PDF)**.

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

---

## 🧠 Intuition
Think of a probability distribution as a **map of uncertainty**:
- For discrete variables → it’s like a bar chart of probabilities.  
- For continuous variables → it’s like a smooth curve showing density.  

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Examples
- Rolling a die → discrete uniform distribution (each face has probability \(1/6\)).  
- Heights of people → approximately normal distribution.  
- Number of customer arrivals per hour → Poisson distribution.  

---

| Distribution | Type | Formula / PMF/PDF | Typical Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bernoulli** | Discrete | $P(X=1)=p,\\; P(X=0)=1-p$ | Single trial with success/failure (coin flip, yes/no outcome). |
| **Binomial** | Discrete | $P(X=k)=\\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ | Number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., 10 coin flips). |
| **Poisson** | Discrete | $P(X=k)=\\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$ | Count of events in fixed time/space (e.g., arrivals per hour, emails per day). |
| **Normal (Gaussian)** | Continuous | $f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$ | Natural phenomena: heights, test scores, measurement errors. |
| **Uniform** | Continuous | $f(x)=\\frac{1}{b-a},\\; a \\leq x \\leq b$ | Equal probability for all values in an interval (random number generator). |
| **Exponential** | Continuous | $f(x)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x},\\; x \\geq 0$ | Time until next event (waiting times, reliability analysis). |

![alt text](images/pdf2.png)

Here’s the visualization you asked for — it shows **both distribution types (Discrete vs Continuous)** along with **plotting examples** for each of the six key probability distributions.  

🔹 **Top row (Discrete distributions):**  
- **Bernoulli** → two bars (0 and 1 outcomes).  
- **Binomial** → bar chart shaped like a small bell (success counts).  
- **Poisson** → bars decreasing as event counts increase.  

🔹 **Bottom row (Continuous distributions):**  
- **Normal** → bell curve centered at mean.  
- **Uniform** → flat rectangle (equal probability across interval).  
- **Exponential** → curve starting high and decaying quickly.  

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Bernoulli** → one coin flip.  
- **Binomial** → many coin flips.  
- **Poisson** → how many arrivals happen in a fixed time.  
- **Normal** → the bell curve, averages and natural variation.  
- **Uniform** → everything equally likely.  
- **Exponential** → waiting time until the next event.  

---

## 🎯 Quick Real-Life Examples
- Bernoulli: Did the machine fail today? (Yes/No)  
- Binomial: How many machines fail in a week?  
- Poisson: How many calls arrive at a call center per hour?  
- Normal: Distribution of exam scores in a class.  
- Uniform: Randomly picking a number between 1 and 10.  
- Exponential: Time until the next customer arrives.  

---

## 1. 🎲 **Bernoulli Distribution**
- **Type:** Discrete  
- **Formula (PMF):**  
  $$
  P(X=1)=p,\quad P(X=0)=1-p
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Models a single trial with two outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).  
- **Example:** Tossing a coin once (success = heads).  

---

## 2. 🎯 **Binomial Distribution**
- **Type:** Discrete  
- **Formula (PMF):**  
  $$
  P(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Number of successes in \(n\) independent Bernoulli trials.  
- **Example:** Number of heads in 10 coin flips.  

---

## 3. 📞 **Poisson Distribution**
- **Type:** Discrete  
- **Formula (PMF):**  
  $$
  P(X=k)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Models the count of events in a fixed interval (time/space), when events occur independently at a constant average rate.  
- **Example:** Number of customer calls per hour at a call center.  

---

## 4. 🔔 **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**
- **Type:** Continuous  
- **Formula (PDF):**  
  $$
  f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Bell‑shaped curve, symmetric around mean \(\mu\). Spread determined by \(\sigma\).  
- **Example:** Human heights, exam scores, measurement errors.  

---

## 5. 📏 **Uniform Distribution**
- **Type:** Continuous  
- **Formula (PDF):**  
  $$
  f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a},\quad a \leq x \leq b
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Every value in the interval \([a,b]\) is equally likely.  
- **Example:** Random number generator between 1 and 10.  

---

## 6. ⏳ **Exponential Distribution**
- **Type:** Continuous  
- **Formula (PDF):**  
  $$
  f(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x},\quad x \geq 0
  $$  
- **Meaning:** Models the time until the next event occurs, given events happen at a constant rate.  
- **Example:** Waiting time until the next bus arrives.  

---

![alt text](images/pdf3.png)

## 🔑 Big Picture
- **Bernoulli** → one trial (yes/no).  
- **Binomial** → many trials (count successes).  
- **Poisson** → count events in time/space.  
- **Normal** → bell curve, natural variation.  
- **Uniform** → equal chance for all values.  
- **Exponential** → waiting time until next event.  

# 17. PDF and PMF

**PMF** and **PDF** are two fundamental ways to describe how probabilities are distributed, depending on whether the random variable is **discrete** or **continuous**.  

---

## 🎲 **PMF — Probability Mass Function**
- **Used for:** **Discrete** random variables (those that take specific, countable values).  
- **Definition:** 

  $$
  P(X = x) = f(x)
  $$
  It gives the probability that the random variable \(X\) takes the exact value \(x\).  
- **Properties:** 

  - \(0 \leq P(X=x) \leq 1\)  
  - \(\sum_x P(X=x) = 1\)  
- **Example:**  
  For a fair die,  
  $$
  P(X=x) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad x = 1,2,3,4,5,6
  $$

  Each outcome has equal probability.  

---

## 📈 **PDF — Probability Density Function**
- **Used for:** **Continuous** random variables (those that can take any value in a range).  
- **Definition:**  
  $$
  f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}P(X \leq x)
  $$
  It describes the *density* of probability at each point, not the probability itself.  
- **Properties:**  
  - \(f(x) \geq 0\)  
  - \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx = 1\)  
- **Example:**  
  For a normal distribution,  
  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$
  The area under the curve between two points gives the probability that \(X\) lies in that interval.  

---

## 🧠 Key Difference

| Feature | PMF | PDF |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Variable type | Discrete | Continuous |
| Gives | Probability of exact value | Probability density (area gives probability) |
| Sum/Integral | Sum of probabilities = 1 | Integral of density = 1 |
| Example | Coin toss, dice roll | Height, weight, temperature |

---

👉 In short:  
- **PMF** → “Probability at a point.”  
- **PDF** → “Probability density across a range.”

# 18. Hypothesis Testing

### 🎯 What is Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population based on sample data.
It helps us decide whether to accept or reject a claim (hypothesis) about the population.

| Test | Used For | Key Formula / Concept | Typical Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Z‑Test** | Tests population mean when **population variance (σ²)** is known and sample size is large ($n > 30$). | $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}$ | Normal distribution, known σ. |
| **T‑Test** | Tests population mean when **σ is unknown** and sample size is small ($n < 30$). | $t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$ | Student’s t‑distribution, unknown σ. |
| **P‑Value Test** | Not a separate test — it’s a **decision metric** used in all tests. | Compare p‑value with significance level (α). | If $p < α$, reject $H_0$. |
| **Chi‑Square Test (χ²)** | Tests relationships between **categorical variables** or goodness‑of‑fit. | $χ² = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$ | Used for frequencies and independence. |
| **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** | Compares **means of 3 or more groups**. | Based on F‑statistic: $F = \\frac{\\text{Between‑group variance}}{\\text{Within‑group variance}}$ | Used when comparing multiple samples. |
| **F‑Test** | Compares **variances** of two populations. | $F = \\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}$ | Used before ANOVA or variance equality tests. |

# **Parametric vs Non‑Parametric Tests**

---

## 📊 Parametric Tests
- **Definition:** Tests that assume the data follows a specific distribution (usually **Normal distribution**) and rely on parameters like mean (\(\mu\)) and variance (\(\sigma^2\)).  
- **Key Assumptions:**  
  - Data is normally distributed.  
  - Variances are equal (homoscedasticity).  
  - Observations are independent.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Z‑Test** → mean comparison (large sample, known σ).  
  - **T‑Test** → mean comparison (small sample, unknown σ).  
  - **ANOVA (F‑Test)** → comparing means across 3+ groups.  
  - **Regression analysis** → testing relationships between variables.  
- **Advantages:** More powerful if assumptions hold.  
- **Limitations:** Misleading if assumptions are violated.  

---

## 📈 Non‑Parametric Tests
- **Definition:** Tests that do **not assume a specific distribution**; they work on ranks, medians, or categorical data.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Useful when data is skewed or not normal.  
  - Often based on **ordinal data** or ranks.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Chi‑Square Test** → independence or goodness‑of‑fit for categorical data.  
  - **Mann‑Whitney U Test** → compare medians of two independent groups.  
  - **Wilcoxon Signed‑Rank Test** → compare paired samples.  
  - **Kruskal‑Wallis Test** → non‑parametric alternative to ANOVA.  
- **Advantages:** Robust, fewer assumptions.  
- **Limitations:** Less powerful than parametric tests if data is actually normal.  

---

## 🧩 Big Picture
| Category | Assumptions | Examples | Data Type |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Parametric** | Normal distribution, equal variance | Z‑Test, T‑Test, ANOVA, F‑Test | Continuous (interval/ratio) |
| **Non‑Parametric** | No distribution assumption | Chi‑Square, Mann‑Whitney, Wilcoxon, Kruskal‑Wallis | Ordinal, categorical, skewed continuous |

---

## 🔑 Takeaway
- Use **parametric tests** when assumptions about normality and variance hold → more statistical power.  
- Use **non‑parametric tests** when data is categorical, ordinal, or violates parametric assumptions → more robust.

# 19. Random Variable and Discrete Random Variable

## 🎲 Random Variable
- **Definition:** A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment.  
- **Types:**  
  1. **Discrete Random Variable** → takes countable values (like integers).  
  2. **Continuous Random Variable** → takes values from an interval (uncountably infinite).  

Think of it as a bridge between the **random experiment** (like tossing a die) and the **mathematical world** (numbers we can analyze).  

---

## 🔢 Discrete Random Variable
- **Definition:** A random variable that can take only **finite or countably infinite values**.  
- **Probability described by:** **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Rolling a die → outcomes {1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
  - Number of heads in 10 coin flips → values {0,1,2,…,10}.  
  - Number of customer arrivals in an hour (Poisson).  

### Formula (PMF):  
$$
P(X=x) = f(x), \quad \sum_x P(X=x) = 1
$$  

---

## 📈 Continuous Random Variable
- **Definition:** A random variable that can take **any value in a continuous range**.  
- **Probability described by:** **PDF (Probability Density Function)**.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Height of students.  
  - Time taken for a bus to arrive.  
  - Temperature readings.  

### Formula (PDF):

- **Discrete Random Variable** = countable outcomes (uses PMF).  
- **Continuous Random Variable** = uncountable outcomes (uses PDF). 
---

## 🎲 Types of Random Variables
Random variables are classified based on the kind of values they can take:

1. **Discrete Random Variable**  
   - Takes **countable values** (finite or infinite).  
   - Probability described by **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**.  
   - Examples: Dice roll, number of heads in coin flips, number of arrivals in an hour.  

2. **Continuous Random Variable**  
   - Takes **uncountably infinite values** within an interval.  
   - Probability described by **PDF (Probability Density Function)**.  
   - Examples: Height, weight, time, temperature.  

---

## 🔢 Types of Discrete Random Variables
Within discrete random variables, we have several important distributions:

1. **Bernoulli Random Variable**  
   - Two outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).  
   - Example: Coin toss.  

2. **Binomial Random Variable**  
   - Number of successes in \(n\) Bernoulli trials.  
   - Example: Number of heads in 10 coin flips.  

3. **Poisson Random Variable**  
   - Counts number of events in a fixed interval (time/space).  
   - Example: Number of calls arriving per hour.  

4. **Discrete Uniform Random Variable**  
   - All outcomes equally likely.  
   - Example: Rolling a fair die (\(P(X=x)=1/6\)).

| **Continuous** | Any value in interval | Normal, Exponential, Continuous Uniform |

# 12. Gaussian Distribution (Normal Distribution)

The **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution** is the most important probability distribution in statistics and science. It's the bell-shaped curve that appears throughout nature and statistics.

---

## 📊 Definition

The normal distribution is defined by its probability density function (PDF):

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Where:
- $\mu$ = mean (center of the distribution)
- $\sigma$ = standard deviation (measure of spread)
- $e$ = Euler's number (≈ 2.718)

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- **Bell-shaped curve** centered at the mean.
- **Symmetric** — left and right sides mirror each other.
- **68-95-99.7 rule:** ~68% of data within 1σ, ~95% within 2σ, ~99.7% within 3σ.

---

## 🎯 Why It's Important
- **Central Limit Theorem** — Sample means follow a normal distribution.
- **Z-scores and t-tests** — rely on normality assumptions.
- **Natural phenomena** — Heights, weights, test scores often follow normal distribution.
- **Statistical inference** — Foundation of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

---

## 📈 Standard Normal Distribution
The **standard normal distribution** has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$:

$$f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}$$

Any normal distribution can be converted to standard normal using z-score:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

---
- And compute their **sample means**,  
- Then as the sample size \(n\) grows large, the distribution of those sample means will **approximate a Normal distribution**, regardless of the population’s original distribution.  

---

## 🧩 Formal Expression
Let \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) be i.i.d. random variables with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\).  
Define the sample mean:  
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$  

Then, as \(n \to \infty\):  
$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \;\;\to\;\; N(0,1)
$$  
That is, the standardized sample mean converges to the **Standard Normal distribution**.  

---

## 📊 Why It Matters
- **Foundation of hypothesis testing**: Z‑tests, t‑tests, confidence intervals rely on CLT.  
- **Practical use**: Even if data is skewed (like income, waiting times), the distribution of averages tends to be Normal.  
- **Real world**: Explains why measurement errors, exam scores, and sampling distributions often look bell‑shaped.  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
- CLT bridges **any distribution → Normal distribution of sample means** (when \(n\) is large).  
- It’s the reason the Normal curve is so central in statistics.

# 20. Confidence Interval
A **Confidence Interval** gives a range of values that is likely to contain the **true population parameter** (like mean or proportion).  
It expresses **uncertainty** in estimation — instead of saying “the mean is 50,” we say “the mean is between 48 and 52 with 95% confidence.”  

---

## 🧩 Formula for Confidence Interval of Mean

### 1. **When population standard deviation (σ) is known (Z‑based CI):**
$$
\text{CI} = \bar{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 2. **When σ is unknown (T‑based CI):**
$$
\text{CI} = \bar{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2,\,df} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:  
- \(\bar{X}\) = sample mean  
- \(n\) = sample size  
- \(\sigma\) or \(s\) = population or sample standard deviation  
- \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) or \(t_{\alpha/2,df}\) = critical value from Z or t distribution  
- \(\alpha\) = significance level (e.g., 0.05 for 95% confidence)  

---

## 📊 Example
Suppose sample mean = 100, \(s = 10\), \(n = 25\), and confidence level = 95%.  
$$
t_{0.025,24} \approx 2.064
$$
$$
\text{CI} = 100 \pm 2.064 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = 100 \pm 4.13
$$
So the **95% CI** is **(95.87, 104.13)**.  

Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true population mean lies between 95.87 and 104.13.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- **Higher confidence level → wider interval.**  
- **Larger sample size → narrower interval.**  
- **CI depends on variability and sample size.**  

---

## 🧠 Connection to CLT
The **Central Limit Theorem** ensures that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately Normal, allowing us to use Z or t values to construct confidence intervals.

# Margin Of Error

**Margin of Error (MoE)** — it’s the companion concept to **Confidence Interval** and tells you how much your sample estimate might differ from the true population value.  

---

## 🎯 What Is Margin of Error?
The **Margin of Error** quantifies the **maximum expected difference** between the sample statistic (like sample mean or proportion) and the true population parameter.  
It defines the “plus‑minus” range around your estimate.  

Example:  
> A survey reports that 60% of people prefer product A, with a margin of error of ±3%.  
> This means the true proportion likely lies between **57% and 63%**.

---

## 🧩 Formula

### 1. **For Mean (Z‑based):**
$$
\text{MoE} = Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 2. **For Mean (T‑based):**
$$
\text{MoE} = t_{\alpha/2,\,df} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 3. **For Proportion:**
$$
\text{MoE} = Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

Where:  
- \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) or \(t_{\alpha/2,df}\) = critical value for confidence level  
- \(\sigma\) or \(s\) = standard deviation  
- \(n\) = sample size  
- \(p\) = sample proportion  

---

## 📊 Relationship to Confidence Interval
$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = \text{Sample Estimate} \pm \text{Margin of Error}
$$

So, the **Margin of Error** is the “half‑width” of the confidence interval.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Larger sample size → smaller margin of error.  
- Higher confidence level → larger margin of error.  
- More variability → larger margin of error.  

---

## 🧠 Example
If sample mean = 100, \(s = 10\), \(n = 25\), and confidence level = 95%:  
$$
t_{0.025,24} = 2.064
$$
$$
\text{MoE} = 2.064 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = 4.13
$$
So the confidence interval is \(100 \pm 4.13 = (95.87, 104.13)\).

# 21. Sampling
Sampling is how we select a subset of data from a population to make inferences.

---

## 🎯 Why Sampling?
- Studying the **entire population** is often impossible (too large, costly, or time‑consuming).  
- Sampling provides a **representative subset** so we can estimate population parameters with confidence.  

---

## 📊 Types of Sampling Techniques

### 1. **Probability Sampling** (every unit has a known chance of selection)
- **Simple Random Sampling**  
  - Each member has equal chance.  
  - Example: Lottery draw.  
- **Systematic Sampling**  
  - Select every \(k^{th}\) element after a random start.  
  - Example: Every 10th customer entering a store.  
- **Stratified Sampling**  
  - Divide population into strata (groups) and sample proportionally.  
  - Example: Sampling students by grade level.  
- **Cluster Sampling**  
  - Divide population into clusters, randomly select clusters, then sample all or some units within them.  
  - Example: Selecting schools, then surveying all students in chosen schools.  

---

### 2. **Non‑Probability Sampling** (selection not based on random chance)
- **Convenience Sampling**  
  - Choose easiest available subjects.  
  - Example: Asking friends for survey responses.  
- **Judgment/Purposive Sampling**  
  - Researcher selects based on expertise.  
  - Example: Choosing “key informants” in a study.  
- **Quota Sampling**  
  - Ensure sample meets certain quotas (e.g., 50% male, 50% female).  
- **Snowball Sampling**  
  - Existing subjects recruit future subjects.  
  - Example: Studying hidden populations (drug users, rare disease patients).  

---

## 🧩 Big Picture
| Category | Technique | Key Feature | Example |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Probability** | Simple Random | Equal chance | Lottery |
| | Systematic | Every k-th element | Every 10th customer |
| | Stratified | Divide into strata | Students by grade |
| | Cluster | Random clusters | Schools → students |
| **Non‑Probability** | Convenience | Easy access | Friends survey |
| | Judgment | Expert choice | Key informants |
| | Quota | Meet quotas | Gender balance |
| | Snowball | Chain referrals | Rare disease study |

---

## 🔑 Takeaway
- **Probability sampling** → more reliable, supports statistical inference.  
- **Non‑probability sampling** → easier, but prone to bias.  

## Random vs Stratified Sampling
---

## 🎲 Simple Random Sampling
- **Definition:** Every unit in the population has an equal chance of being selected.  
- **Process:** Use random numbers, lottery method, or computer randomization.  
- **Advantages:** Easy to understand, unbiased if truly random.  
- **Limitations:** May not represent subgroups well if population is diverse.  
- **Example:** Selecting 100 students randomly from a university of 10,000.  

---

## 📊 Stratified Sampling
- **Definition:** Population is divided into **strata (subgroups)** based on characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income), then samples are drawn proportionally or equally from each stratum.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Identify strata.  
  2. Decide sample size from each stratum.  
  3. Randomly select within each stratum.  
- **Advantages:** Ensures representation of all subgroups, increases precision.  
- **Limitations:** Requires detailed population information to form strata.  
- **Example:** Sampling 100 students but ensuring proportional representation from each department (Engineering, Arts, Science).  

---

## 🧩 Side‑by‑Side Comparison

| Feature | Random Sampling | Stratified Sampling |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Selection** | Entire population, equal chance | Divide into strata, then sample |
| **Representation** | May miss subgroups | Ensures subgroup representation |
| **Complexity** | Simple | More complex |
| **Bias Risk** | Low if random | Low, but depends on correct stratification |
| **Example** | Lottery draw | Sampling by department |

---

## 🔑 Takeaway
- Use **Random Sampling** when population is homogeneous.  
- Use **Stratified Sampling** when population is heterogeneous and you want subgroup representation.  

## Sampling Bias vs Selection Bias

## 🎯 Sampling Bias
- **Definition:** Occurs when the sample collected is **not representative of the population**.  
- **Cause:** The method of sampling systematically favors certain outcomes.  
- **Impact:** Leads to incorrect conclusions because the sample doesn’t reflect the true population.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Surveying only urban residents to estimate national income.  
  - Collecting data only from morning shoppers in a mall (missing evening crowd).  

---

## 📊 Selection Bias
- **Definition:** A broader concept — occurs when **individuals or groups are more likely to be included/excluded** from the study due to non‑random selection.  
- **Cause:** The way participants are chosen (or self‑select) skews the results.  
- **Impact:** Distorts the relationship between variables being studied.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Studying health outcomes only among people who visit hospitals (ignores those who don’t seek care).  
  - Online polls where only internet users can respond.  

---

## 🧩 Key Difference
| Aspect | Sampling Bias | Selection Bias |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Specific to how the sample is drawn | Broader — includes sampling bias but also self‑selection |
| **Cause** | Faulty sampling method | Non‑random inclusion/exclusion of participants |
| **Example** | Only surveying college students for national opinion | Only people with strong opinions respond to a survey |

---

## 🔑 Takeaway
- **Sampling Bias** is a type of **Selection Bias**.  
- Both reduce the validity of statistical inference.  
- The cure: use **probability sampling methods** (random, stratified, cluster) and ensure proper representation.  

---

## Under-Sampling vs Over-Sampling

---

## 🎯 Under‑Sampling
- **Definition:** Reduce the size of the majority class (or dataset) to balance with the minority class.  
- **Goal:** Prevent the majority class from dominating the model.  
- **Advantages:** Faster training, less data to process.  
- **Disadvantages:** Risk of losing valuable information.  
- **Example:** In fraud detection, if you have 10,000 “non‑fraud” cases and 500 “fraud” cases, you might randomly select 500 “non‑fraud” cases to match the minority.

---

## 📊 Over‑Sampling
- **Definition:** Increase the size of the minority class (or dataset) to balance with the majority class.  
- **Goal:** Give the minority class more weight in training.  
- **Advantages:** Retains all majority data, improves minority representation.  
- **Disadvantages:** Risk of overfitting (especially if duplicating data).  
- **Example:** In fraud detection, you might duplicate or synthetically generate “fraud” cases until they match the 10,000 “non‑fraud” cases.

---

## 🧩 Side‑by‑Side Comparison

| Aspect | Under‑Sampling | Over‑Sampling |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Method** | Reduce majority class | Increase minority class |
| **Data Loss** | Yes, majority data discarded | No, but duplicates may be added |
| **Risk** | Losing information | Overfitting |
| **Use Case** | Large majority class | Very small minority class |
| **Example** | Drop “non‑fraud” cases | Duplicate “fraud” cases |

---

## 🔑 Takeaway
- **Under‑Sampling**: Cut down the majority class → faster but less information.  
- **Over‑Sampling**: Boost the minority class → better balance but risk of overfitting.  
- In practice, advanced methods like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over‑sampling Technique)** are often used to generate synthetic minority samples instead of simple duplication.
